• Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. The virus can survive for about 72 hours on 
different surfaces. 
• Sanitizing every possible surface is one of the current devised ways in precautionary measures. 
What if we can do our daily chores without having to touch anything. The lesser you touch, the safer 
you are. Even while washing our hands we touch the surfaces of the cleaning agent or water tap, so 
there are chances of the virus being settled on the surfaces. 
• Dr. Sanitor- A smart mechanical liquid disinfectant dispenser, which dispenses fluid without having 
to touch the bottle. It uses a pedal mechanism for its operation. Safer and cost-effective 
precautionary measures.

• What it does: Acts like mini ICU units that can intelligently manage quarantined spaces by tracking 
respiratory rate (early indicator for SARS or CoVI). Using AI, quarantined patients can be 
categorized on risk and admitted to ICU.
• Important Feature: Uses AI algorithm and sensor hardware to track breathing and predict health 
events (including fever and CoVID symptoms).
• Where to use: Quarantine facilities. Any space can be converted into a mini ICU space with this 
product. A central database to track who is getting worse in Quarantine and who is getting better 
in quarantine. Also enforces quarantine which is the need of the hour.
• Why it's important: Non-contact, non-invasive, reusable, affordable mini ICU units with minimal 
clinic setting. Also reduces inflow into hospitals and reduces the burden on healthcare 
professionals.

• Ozone is known to kill 99.7% of all microbes including viruses. 
• Ozone gas has been proven to kill the SARS coronavirus and since the structure of the new 2019-nCoV 
coronavirus is almost identical to that of the SARS coronavirus, it is relatively safe to say that it will 
also work on the new coronavirus. 
• This could be a cost-effective large scale sanitizing process for industries, homes, public spaces with 
multiple applications for surfaces, indoor-air, and even water. 
• This is also a Green technology as it doesn't need anything except electricity to run with no residue
generated in the process.

• Upon touching of surfaces by COVID infected patients, the SARS-CoV-2 virus stays on surfaces for 
days/hours. It is, therefore, necessary to have anti-microbial surfaces that can help in killing the virus 
before it latches on to a healthy host.
• India needs to ramp up separate quarantine facilities based on the level of symptoms and therefore 
it is necessary to segregate people showing mild symptoms from those displaying major symptoms. 
• The HYG rooms are prefabricated isolation rooms, measuring 3mx3mx2.4m, and can be deployed at

therefore, eliminates the need for direct contact with waste and hence minimizes many kinds of 
health and safety risks for the sanitation workers. In context to COVID-19, it has a significant role to 
protect the sanitation workers from the transmission of COVID-19 through contaminated waste. 
• The use of swachhta picker will add another barrier to such transmission by physical distancing of 
waste from sanitation workers and would protect them to get infected. Moreover, the equipment 
is not just for corona, it would be used for the long term to save the workers from a lot of other 
health and safety risks on account of their job.
